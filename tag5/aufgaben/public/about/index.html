            <p>In a cozy pen, not far away,
                Lived a piggy named Dumpy.
                With a belly so round, and cheeks plump with cheer,
                He snuffled and snorted, his oinks rang clear.</p>
            <p>Dumpy the piggy, a sight to behold,
                In the meadow he wandered, in search of gold‚Äî
                Not gold of coins, nor treasures untold,
                But food! Oh, food! His heart's true mold.</p>
            <p>Through fields of green, he'd waddle and roam,
                In his quest for treats, he'd eagerly comb.
                Apples, corn, and oats, his favorites to find,
                Each munch and crunch left him quite inclined.</p>
            <p>He'd gobble and slurp, without any care,
                With each tasty morsel, he'd puff up his air.
                His appetite grand, a joy to behold,
                Dumpy, the piggy, with stories untold.</p>
